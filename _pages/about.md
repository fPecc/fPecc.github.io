I studied Electronics Engineering at the [National Technological University (UTN-FRBA)](https://www.frba.utn.edu.ar/en/) in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 2014 to 2021. During that time he also worked for Siemens Argentina specifying and implementing software solutions for industry partners in the food & beverage industry. I am currently a computer science PhD Student at the [Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen (EKUT)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Oliver Bringmann](https://www.embedded.uni-tuebingen.de/team/oliver-bringmann/). Since 2021 I am also working as a researcher assistant at the [FZI Research Center for Information Technology](https://www.fzi.de/) in Karlsruhe, Germany.

Research interests
======
I am fascinated by the challenges presented by the deployment of AI algorithms on edge devices. As such, I am currently working on hardware/software co-design methods to enable the efficient execution of AI algorithms on the edge. Although I have been focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks for computer vision tasks I am also interested in reinforcement learning techniques, transformers networks and Spiking Neural Networks. I am currently working on efficient mapping and deployment strategies for neural networks on heterogeneous systems, using the TVM compiler as a framework to accelerate the implementation of my ideas.
